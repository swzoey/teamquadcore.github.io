### Local Market is held every weekend in front of Ferry Building.
 > We visit it and taste some local food. After having lunch at Ziggy’s burger, we went to Coi tower and could see golden bridge & alcatraz because of the weather. There is the second largest Chinatown in Sanfrancisco. We felt like we are in China. It was a little tough day, but we had a good memory! 

## Our route

## REVIEW

        <dd>We was supposed to go meet-up , but most attendees are 50-60s. So we decide to hang out by ourselves. It was great choice. We walked and went around from Ferry building to Union Square, the distance was really long, but I felt so good cause I always sit and do Mvp project. It was good to refresh my mind!

        <dd>was worried about the rain coming but the weather was very nice. We saw many local market in Ferry Building and experienced their atmosphere. Coi tower was very grand. It was hard to get there because it was too high. But it was nice experience. China town was an environment that made me misunderstand that I an in America. But I do not want to go again….

        <dd>Ferry Building was more beautiful as I expected. Nice weather and delicious food perfectly supported my nice day. Also Coi Tower was enough to capture my mind. It was very hard journey, but It was good to me for organizing my thoughts. It was nice day!</dd>

        <dd>The beach near the Ferry Building was really good. The weather was good and everything was perfect! The road from Ferry Building to Coi tower was extremly high and difficult. But, the landscape of arriving made me think that i didn’t waste my sweat.</dd>
